# RoundUp #

Social inclusion locally, globally and through pay it forward.

We built a product for MasterCard and Merchants to get into the crowdfunding space. Anyone with a MasterCard can start a fundraising campaign. Merchants can decide which campaigns they host. Our solution can be integrated into a POS or ecommerce experience (regardless of payment provider.) Small round ups, big difference.
